Proxy model for ecosystem interactions.  Made to test messaging for different
types of coupling.  Currently supports examples for file transfer after running
models to completion, file transfer after running time-steps, one-way coupling
from model_1 to model_2.  

# Examples
Examples are accessible in the example directory.  Change the path of each
config.ini file and run which configuration you wish.  To run, execute the
example.py script from your favorite IDE.
